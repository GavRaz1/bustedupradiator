-----===THE GOAL===-----
make a program (which could become a proper os) that boots from a .efi bootloader
--> prolly just gonna try and make it print something to the screen or do a fun CLI visual from like neofetch lmao
-----===THE SACRIFICE===-----
an old lenovo thinkpad from its education series that has like an intel celeron, 4 gigs of ram, and 128 gig memory
--> it runs linux mint cinnamon rn
